fritzbox-config-downloader
==========================

Downloads a configuration backup of an AVM Fritz!Box to the local file Fritzbox.export.
Originally developed for automatic backups with rsnapshot.
It supports downloading the condig through the internet with the function Fernzugriff.
The configuration is ecrypted with password "admin". Without a password you cannot
load the config into another Fritzbox.

Usage: ./fritzbox-config-downloader [hostname[:Port] [Password [Username [Fernzugriff [SecondPassword]]]]]

hostname[:Port]		Hostname or IP of the Fritzbox to backup. Portnumber is optional.
			Default is "fritz.box"
Password		Password of the Fritzbox.
Username		Username for newer Fritzbox or Fernzugriff
Fernzugriff		Set to 1 to connect to a Fritzbox via Fernzugriff through the
			internet (uses for example https)
SecondPassword		Older Boxes secure Fernzugriff with HTTP-Auth. If the box has
			additionally a password for local access to the webinterface,
			then this password is needed, too. In this case, pass the
			Fernzugriff password as second parameter >Password< and the
			local Webinterface password as >SecondPassword<.
			Fritz!box OS 5.50 fixes this Bug, it doesn't need this parameter
			any more.
